# Hey there, i'm Breanna (she/her)! 👋🏾
I'm a Computer & Entrepreneurship major @ Northeastern University 🐾. At the moment I am still figuring out what my niche is in the tech world, but I know that I love to code. When I'm not in classes or working I am usually expanding my knowledge on front-end frameworks such as React.js and Angular. I also spend my time diversifying the tech and entrepreneurial ecosystems to create a world without boundaries 🌍! 

Outside of my professional life I can usually be found at any concert or music festival 🎵. (Big fan of Alternative music over here!) Or playing video games likes Animal Crossing, Age of Empires 2, and Legend of Zelda 🎮.

## What I'm currently working on
I am a part of my school's venture accelerator [IDEA](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/). Our tech team has a lot of exciting things lined up, so please stay tuned!

Other than that, I am working on a personal project that I like to call Soundtrackify (yes, it uses the Spotify API). At the moment the project is a secret but I hope to get it out soon. In addition I am also revamping my personal website for all to see!

## Wanna get in contact? Awesome!
